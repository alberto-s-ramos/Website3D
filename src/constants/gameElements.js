        description: "Way Out is a 3D low poly puzzle game where you play as a golem who just woke up in a mysterious laboratory and is trying to figure out the purpose of his existence. To do so, he has to solve puzzles and challenges in a dungeon-like environment to both progress through the map and find clues about himself. This game was developed as a part of my Master’s thesis about attentional skills and mental workload in games. The puzzles were designed to test   and map these two aspects. The hidden plot is that a human scientist has become the first to achieve full conscience transmutation. The puzzles the golem has to solve were created by the golem himself in his human form, and are a simple way to determine if the scientist’s cognitive and reasoning skills have remained intact in his new body.",

Me and my groupmates developed a 3D low poly game that explored the basic concepts of survival games, such as harvesting materials, hunting animals, gathering various resources, and adventuring through the map. This course was structured to give students an overview of the entire game development experience, starting nearly from scratches and brainstorming with groupmates to competition and domain analysis. One of the best parts of this class was the opportunity to work alongside two art students who designed specific assets for our game and helped us improve the overall look and feel of the game environment. Teaming up with people from distinct background and with varied skillsets was an amazing learning experience.",

        description: "LootMachinaX was the first 3D game I developed for a Game Design course. The course parameters were very broad and allowed us the freedom to create any sort of game within the theme “Ex-Lootbox”. From this starting point, I designed an exploration game where the goal was to find different loot boxes scattered around the map while exploring a 3D environment. Each of the boxes contained a different augmentation  (e.g. ‘super jump’, ‘rush’, ‘break crystals’) which broadened the player’s capacity to interact with the game world. This course and the work I put into the final project made me fall in love with game development. Many times I found myself excited to get to my desk and work on the game.",
